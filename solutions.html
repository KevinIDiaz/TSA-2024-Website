              Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity. Solar energy can
              power most and sometimes all of a homeâ€™s electricity needs. The
              panels are made to survive storm and hail damage and can withstand
              the ultraviolet rays of the sun. They are reliable and require
              little to no maintenance. Panels are typically grouped on a
              building rooftop or at ground level in a rack to form a PV array.
              These arrays are usually angled specifically to capture as much
              sunlight as possible throughout the day.

              Geothermal heat pumps are one of many great ways to help the
              environment. It uses the ground to transfer heat to and from a
              home. Since ground temperatures are much more consistent compared
              to air temperatures. Throughout most of the United States, the
              upper 10 feet of ground stays at a temperature of 45 -75 degrees
              while air temperature can range from 0 to 100 degrees. This allows
              geothermal heat pumps to be two to three times more efficient.
